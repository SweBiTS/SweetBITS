    """
    Computes hierarchical clade counts dynamically from direct taxon counts using 
    a highly optimized 'Level-Up Voting' algorithm.
    
    This function processes the taxonomic tree layer-by-layer from leaves to root.
    At each layer, nodes are evaluated against quality thresholds. Surviving nodes
    vote their clade sums up to their parents. Failed nodes are pruned recursively, 
    purifying the lineage signals above them.

    Args:
        df               : Long-format DataFrame with 't_id', 'sample_id', and 'taxon_reads'.
        tree             : The loaded JolTree taxonomy cache.
        min_reads        : Minimum maximum read count across all samples to survive.
        min_observed     : Minimum number of non-zero samples to survive.
        keep_composition : If True, returns a sum of pruned clade reads for mass balance.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - A new DataFrame with updated 'taxon_reads' (orphans removed) and new 'clade_reads'.
        - A NumPy array of reads placed into the synthetic bin per sample (if keep_composition).
